# Precesion_Agriculture
Precision Agriculture leverages machine learning to enhance farming practices. This project includes three core models: crop recommendation, fertilizer recommendation, and disease detection, integrated into a user-friendly web interface developed using Flask.

### Features

-  Crop Recommendation: Suggests suitable crops based on soil and environmental data.
-  Fertilizer Recommendation: Provides tailored fertilizer advice.
-  Disease Detection: Identifies plant diseases from images and suggests treatments.
-  Web Interface: A Flask-based application for easy interaction with the models.

## Steps
- Clone the repository:
  >git clone https://github.com/yourusername/precision-agriculture.git
  >cd precision-agriculture
- Install the required packages:
  >pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run the application:
  >python app.py

## Models
- ## Crop Recommendation
- - - Analyzes soil and environmental factors to suggest optimal crops.

- ## Fertilizer Recommendation
- - - Recommends the best fertilizer based on crop type and soil conditions.

- ## Disease Detection
- - - Uses CNNs to identify plant diseases from images and provide treatment suggestions.

- ## Web Interface
- - - Built with Flask, the web interface allows easy input of data and viewing of results.
